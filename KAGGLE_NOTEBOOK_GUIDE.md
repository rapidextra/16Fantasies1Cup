# 🏈 Running Your Kaggle Notebook

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Step 1: Run Your Notebook on Kaggle**

1. **Go to [Kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com)** and sign in
2. **Find your notebook**: `notebook5292a14ad1 (1).ipynb`
3. **Open the notebook**
4. **Click "Run All"** or run cells one by one
5. **Wait for completion** - it should generate `creative_brief_week2.yaml`

### **Step 2: Get the YAML File**

**Option A: Download from Kaggle**
1. **Download** the `creative_brief_week2.yaml` file from your notebook output
2. **Save it** to your local project: `data/weekly/creative_brief_week2.yaml`

**Option B: Upload to Kaggle Dataset**
1. **Go to your dataset**: `jgade/16-fantasies-1-cup`
2. **Upload** the `creative_brief_week2.yaml` file
3. **Name it exactly**: `creative_brief_week2.yaml`

### **Step 3: Generate Newsletters**

**Option A: Use the Automated Workflow**
```bash
python scripts/run_kaggle_workflow.py
```

**Option B: Manual Steps**
```bash
# Convert YAML to newsletter format
python scripts/convert_kaggle_data.py --yaml-file "data/weekly/creative_brief_week2.yaml" --week 2

# Generate post-week newsletter
python scripts/generate_newsletter.py --week 2 --title "Week 2 Recap"

# Generate pre-week newsletter
python scripts/generate_preweek_newsletter.py --week 3 --title "Week 3 Preview"
```

## 🔧 **Notebook Configuration**

### **Key Variables to Check**
In your notebook, make sure these are set correctly:

```python
# Season and week to analyze
SEASON = 2025
WEEK_TO_ANALYZE = 2  # Change this for different weeks

# League ID (should be correct for 2025)
LEAGUE_ID = "1253588484954787841"
```

### **Expected Output**
Your notebook should generate:
- **Standings**: Overall and divisional rankings
- **Matchups**: Detailed team performance analysis
- **Awards**: 5 different award categories
- **YAML File**: `creative_brief_week2.yaml`

## 📊 **Data Flow**

```
Sleeper API → Your Notebook → YAML File → Newsletter System → HTML Newsletters
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Notebook Won't Run**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure all required packages are installed
   - Verify your Sleeper API access

2. **YAML File Not Generated**
   - Check the last cell of your notebook
   - Ensure the file is saved correctly
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Newsletter Generation Fails**
   - Verify the YAML file is in the correct location
   - Check the file format matches expected structure
   - Run the conversion script first

### **Testing Your Setup**

```bash
# Test the complete workflow
python scripts/run_kaggle_workflow.py

# Test individual components
python scripts/convert_kaggle_data.py --yaml-file "data/weekly/creative_brief_week2.yaml" --week 2
python scripts/generate_newsletter.py --week 2
```

## 📈 **Weekly Workflow**

### **Monday (Post-Week)**
1. **Run your Kaggle notebook** for the completed week
2. **Download the YAML file**
3. **Generate post-week newsletter**
4. **Share with your league**

### **Wednesday (Pre-Week)**
1. **Generate pre-week newsletter** for upcoming week
2. **Share predictions and storylines**

### **Repeat Weekly**
- **Automated process** once set up
- **Real data** from Sleeper API
- **Professional newsletters** every week

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After running your notebook and generating newsletters, you should have:

- **Real Standings**: Actual league standings with correct records
- **Matchup Analysis**: Detailed breakdowns with real scores
- **Awards Section**: Your calculated awards (highest scorer, bonehead, etc.)

- **Pre-Week Predictions**: Smart predictions for upcoming week

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
